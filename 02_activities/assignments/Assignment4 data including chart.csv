Questions,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. What software did you use to create your data visualization?
Created the data visualization using microsoft excel.


2. Who is your intended audience?
The intended audience is likely individuals or professionals involved in public health, epidemiology, or those interested in understanding trends in infection rates over time for different age groups. This could include healthcare policymakers, researchers, and the general public.


3. What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization?
The visualization aims to show the trends in the percentage of positive cases (7-day average) over time across different age categories. It helps convey how the infection rates varied for different segments of the population and highlights which age groups experienced peaks or significant changes during specific time periods.


4. What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots?

Substantive Principles:
The visualization is data-driven, focusing on providing insights into percent positive trends over time. I chose to include all age categories present in the dataset to ensure completeness.

Perceptual Principles:
Legibility: I used color coding for each age group to distinguish between them easily. The x-axis and y-axis labels are clear, indicating dates and percentage positivity, respectively.
Gridlines and Labels: The gridlines help provide context for the data points, making it easier to interpret specific values.

Aesthetic Principles:
The colors used in the plot are distinct enough to differentiate each age group, and the lines have been drawn smoothly to represent trends over time. The legend is placed in a way that allows the viewer to quickly match colors to age categories.
Visual Balance: I made sure that all elements (title, labels, legend) were well-positioned to avoid cluttering and overwhelming the reader.


5. How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization?
The visualization is partially reproducible because it was created using Excel, it also has certain limitations when compared to programmatic data visualization tools such as Python. Excel allows me to create this chart templates and it can be reused across different datasets. This can help maintain consistency across visualizations, making the process more reproducible if you always apply the same template.

6. How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?",,,,,,,,,,,,
